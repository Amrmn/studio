# yaLLMa3

ِyaLLMa3 is a framework for building AI agents that are capable of learning from their environment and interacting with it. This project is inspired by the [Rivet](https://github.com/Ironclad/rivet) project, however it is taking a different approach to building agents, deployment and integration of agents into applications. More information about the project approach and goals can be found in the [web site](https://yallma3.org).

This repo contains the IDE for yaLLMa3 (yaLLMa3-studio), which is a visual IDE that allows you to build agents and packages that can be used to build applications.
